### **Do Normal People need to monitor their glucose?** 

**Glucose literally affects everyone.** 
This includes our mood, sleep, weight, skin, immune system health, risk of heart disease, and chances of conception. A previous study showed that only 12% of Americans have a healthy metabolism, which means that only 12% of Americans have perfectly functioning bodies, including having healthy blood sugar levels. **In other words, 9 out of 10 of the people closest to us may be riding the "glucose roller coaster" without even realizing it**."

**Why 'blood sugar' and not 'calories'?**
Dramatic fluctuations in blood sugar levels can lead to erratic energy levels, mood swings, increased hunger, and long-term health problems. Smooth blood sugar levels help maintain stable energy and mood, and research shows that keeping an eye on blood sugar can improve health in many ways. Quality of food is more important than quantity. High-quality foods (such as fiber-rich foods) help maintain stable blood sugar levels, rather than simply reducing calorie intake. Focusing on calories alone makes it easier to fall into dieting anxiety.
